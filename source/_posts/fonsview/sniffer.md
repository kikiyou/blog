# sniffer


### Sniffer

- [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) - Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. Wireshark is very similar to tcpdump, but has a graphical front-end, plus some integrated sorting and filtering options.
- [netsniff-ng](http://netsniff-ng.org/) -  netsniff-ng is a free Linux networking toolkit, a Swiss army knife for your daily Linux network plumbing if you will. Its gain of performance is reached by zero-copy mechanisms, so that on packet reception and transmission the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernel space to user space and vice versa.
- [Live HTTP headers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-http-headers/iaiioopjkcekapmldfgbebdclcnpgnlo?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) - Live HTTP headers is a free chrome extension to see your browser requests in real time. It shows the entire headers of the requests and can be used to find the security loopholes in implementations.

### Monitoring / Logging

- [snyk.io](https://snyk.io/) -  Snyk is a opensource tool to scan for vulnerabilities. Find, fix and monitor for known vulnerabilities in Node.js npm package fixtures used for testing the patches of vulndb.

- [justniffer](http://justniffer.sourceforge.net/) - Justniffer is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and produces logs in a customized way, can emulate Apache web server log files, track response times and extract all "intercepted" files from the HTTP traffic.

- [httpry](http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry/) - httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.

- [ngrep](http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/) - ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.

- [passivedns](https://github.com/gamelinux/passivedns) - A tool to collect DNS records passively to aid Incident handling, Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and general digital forensics. PassiveDNS sniffs traffic from an interface or reads a pcap-file and outputs the DNS-server answers to a log file. PassiveDNS can cache/aggregate duplicate DNS answers in-memory, limiting the amount of data in the logfile without loosing the essens in the DNS answer.

- [sagan](http://sagan.quadrantsec.com/) - Sagan uses a 'Snort like' engine and rules to analyze logs (syslog/event log/snmptrap/netflow/etc).

- [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net/) -  OSSEC is an Open Source Host-based Intrusion Detection System that performs log analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerting and active response. It runs on most operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Windows.

- [ntopng](http://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-analysis/ntop/) - Ntopng is a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does.
- [Fibratus](https://github.com/rabbitstack/fibratus) - Fibratus is a tool for exploration and tracing of the Windows kernel. It is able to capture the most of the Windows kernel activity - process/thread creation and termination, file system I/O, registry, network activity, DLL loading/unloading and much more. Fibratus has a very simple CLI which encapsulates the machinery to start the kernel event stream collector, set kernel event filters or run the lightweight Python modules called filaments.
